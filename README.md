# Online-Payment-Fraud-Detection

PROJECT DEFINITION: Fraud detection is defined as a process that detects scams and prevents fraudsters from obtaining money or property through false means. Fraud is a serious business risk that needs to be identified and mitigated in time.

The aim of this project is to predict online payment fraud in a transaction data from kaggale. And also to compare various Machine Learning algorithms.

Upon training and evaluating our classification model, we found that the Random Forest model performed the best by a narrow margin.

Therefore, Random Forest performs best with recall cross-validation accuracy of 88% which is important for our problem statement where false negative is our priority
